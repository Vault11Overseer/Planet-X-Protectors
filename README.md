  ## Short Description
  This is a Space Alien Defender game.
  
  ## Long Description
  Good morning, you live on a planet far far in the deep reaches of space. 
  This morning our radar detectors have a mass swarm of space beetles outside of our normal asteroid attacks. 
  We need you at the helm to keep the beetles at bay.
 
  Please man the turret on the rocket and keep those damn bugs at bay!
 
  Make sure you remove at least 20 beetles, while we prepare our bombs.

  #LEVEL 1
  It starts off like a normal day blasting away at stray asteroids.
